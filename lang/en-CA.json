Although we typically establish a clear understanding of a project's goals in the early stages, uncertainties inevitably arise, and our grasp of the best solutions evolves with progress.</p><p>Given the shifting ground, my recommended approach is to provide estimates based on a day rate rather than a fixed price. Embracing this flexible method allows us to concentrate on delivering the most suitable solution as we gain further insights.</p><p>However, if a fixed quote is a prerequisite, I recommend opting for a brief discovery project. The outcome of this will be a fixed scope, or at least a narrow range, with associated costs, ensuring clarity and transparency in the pricing structure.</p>"

While other content management systems are available, I lean towards using a <a href=\"https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-explained\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">Headless CMS</a>. This type of system separates how your content looks (the presentation layer) from where it's stored and managed (the backend).
