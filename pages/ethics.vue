      <p>
        My commitment to helping clients make responsible choices extends to my
        own company. I strive to run an ethical business that can be a force for
        good.

      <p>This is a work in progress.</p>

      <h6 class="uppercase">WHAT I’VE DONE</h6>
      <p>
        Most of my work is project-based, but I’m available for design and
        development retainers, too. Retainers are based on guaranteeing an
        agreed number of days per month. I don’t oversell my time.
      </p>

      <h6 class="uppercase">WHAT I WON’T DO</h6>
      <p>
        Estimating projects is always a challenge. We’ll likely have a clear
        idea of a project’s goals early in our discussions, but there are
        invariably unknowns and our understanding of the best solutions will
        evolve as we work.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this in mind, I usually quote estimates based on a day rate rather
        than a fixed price. Adopting this flexible approach lets us focus on
        delivering the most appropriate solution as we discover more.
